Approach:
I created a portfolio site that is both simple and easy to navigate.
I wanted the user to engage with the page, but not be distracted by those interactions.
I utilized jquery for navigation elements, javascript for the site counter.
I am using scripts from jqueryUi library and api.countapi.xyz for some added functionality and simplicity.
One area that I will need to revisit is my nav bar and ghost buttons - they are created as <a> tags,
and for assistive tech-functionality and accessibility, I will be changing them to buttons.
