Approach:
I created a portfolio site that is both simple and easy to navigate.
I wanted the user to engage with the page easily and with purpose, but not be distracted by those interactions.
I utilized two Application Programming Interfaces (API's) in my site:
1) the site-visit counter is a simple counter API that helps track this information.
2) the accordion api widgit was added to hide complexity and improve functionality - this was developed by the JqueryUi community.
One area that I will need to revisit is my nav bar and ghost buttons - they are created as <a> tags,
and for assistive tech-functionality and accessibility, I will be changing them to buttons.
